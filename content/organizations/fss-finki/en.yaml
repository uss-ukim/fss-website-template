    The Faculty Student Assembly at FINKI is the official student body
    representing the students of FINKI. We are a faculty unit formed in
    accordance with the law on higher education, where students from both the
    first and second cycle of studies have the right to participate. The members
    are elected through public, direct, and secret elections held every year.
    The Faculty Student Assembly is composed of 10 members, including one
    president and nine program representatives.
mission:
  mission: >
    We fight to prove that faculties belong to the students and that students
    should have the main voice in them. This means we strive to improve the
    student standard, which is currently at a very low level, to unite the
    students and present a collective front before professors and the dean's
    office for all the problems we face and the changes we want to see. Besides
    providing better conditions for studying at the faculty, we offer students
    opportunities to expand their knowledge and learn additional skills not
    covered in the curriculum by organizing events, seminars, workshops, and
    initiatives.
